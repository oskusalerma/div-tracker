div-tracker is a simple web app for keeping track of your dividend income.
It makes it easy to see all of your dividend payments from various sources
in one place, calculate totals for tax reporting purposes, etc.

All the data must be entered by you in a CSV file manually; the web app is
read-only, it never modifies any of your data.

Run ./initial-setup.sh one time to setup the virtualenv environment and
install the needed dependencies, and after that use ./run.sh to launch the
application and then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your webbrowser.
